HouseSwap is my final project for the Developer's Institute Python Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp

It is a culmination of the 12 weeks of intense learning and exercises that started with HTML/CSS, progressed with the basics of JavaScript, 
and led up to Python and Django.

This project was coded in Python, built on the Django framework. I came up with the idea after looking for affordable vacation ideas for the summer, 
and after seeing other successfull house swap sites, decided to create one specific to Israel.

The site includes listings using CRUD methods, forums, messaging, reviews.  

You can take a peek at the live site at  https://israelhouseswap.pythonanywhere.com/
